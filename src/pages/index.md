# SydCSS Code of Conduct

The SydCSS meetup is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the SydCSS organisers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery are inappropriate for any SydCSS event or communication channel.

Community members are not to use SydCSS meetings or communication channels to proposition any other member.

Community members asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors and presenters are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.

If a community member engages in harassing behaviour, the SydCSS organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the SydCSS community. If you are being harassed, please contact a SydCSS organiser immediately. If you notice someone else being harassed, please intercede or contact a SydCSS organiser immediately. If you have any other concerns, please contact a SydCSS organiser.

SydCSS organisers may, at their discretion, treat breaches of our code of conduct in other communities as if they occurred within SydCSS-run community events. Patterns of behaviour within peer groups of SydCSS will be treated as if they occurred within SydCSS.

SydCSS organisers may, at their discretion, notify peer groups of breaches of our code of conduct if deemed appropriate.
